# Final Project - 2020 Election Predictions
## CS109a: Intro to Data Sciences
Project members: Estelle Yao, Ivan Shu, Saul Holding and Noah Ramos

## Broad Impact Statement
The main purpose of this project is to forecast the results for both the presidential and federal House of Representative elections in the year of 2020. After constructing the model, it came to our attention that the top three influential features are the racial class of white American, voting consistency and advanced education in graduate degrees. At least in this project, demographics played a huge role driving our model prediction. Therefore, when conducting future machine learning research, it is worthwhile considering the underlying demographic data. For instance, if only accounting for certain racial classes, it is likely that it would result in unfair predictions. Additionally, what needs to be cautious when deploying this model to future predictions is that it does not capture other spontaneous features. For example, during the 2020 election year, a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was permeating throughout the United States. This particular spontaneity was not included in our model and could have caused our model to give poor predictions on some of the swing states. Another example is the incidences of police brutality and one of the major consequences was the distrust against the present government, which could act as another major factor driving the prediction into a different direction. With those uncertainties in mind, our model, however, did a good job uncovering some important features for one of the most important political events in the United States. It benefits and hints us to think about future elections from the perspectives of demographics, economics, financials, voting resources and behaviors.
